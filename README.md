### When I'm not brushing funny strokes onto my canvas or slinging code, you can find me nose-deep in a good book, preferably one that involves hobbits, orcs, and wizards. And speaking of wizards, I have a bit of an obsession with Gandalf. I mean, who wouldn't want to be as wise, powerful, and stylishly-bearded as him? And who knows, maybe one day I'll even figure out how to cast a few spells like Gandalf. ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜‰
